        <h1>Accessibility Testing Bookmarklets</h1>
        <p>The bookmarklets in this repository can help with auditing and testing a web application for accessibility
            issues. Some of them were heavily inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/pauljadam/bookmarklets">bookmarklets
                by Paul J. Adam</a> but don't use externals scripts and / or jQuery so they also work under rather
            restrictive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" rel="nofollow">CSP headers /
                meta tags</a>.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>To install a bookmarklet, drag the link to your browser bookmarks:</p>
        <ul>
            <!-- inject:bookmarklet -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </ul>
    </body>
