# Accessibility Testing Bookmarklets

The bookmarklets in this repository can help with auditing and testing a web application for accessibility issues. Some of them were heavily inspired by the [bookmarklets by Paul J. Adam](https://github.com/pauljadam/bookmarklets) but don't use externals scripts and / or jQuery so they also work under rather restrictive [CSP headers / meta tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
