# Accessibility Testing Bookmarklets

The bookmarklets in this repository can help with auditing and testing a web application for accessibility issues. Some
of them were at least heavily inspired by the [bookmarklets by Paul J. Adam](https://github.com/pauljadam/bookmarklets)
but don't use externals scripts and / or jQuery so they also work under rather
restrictive [CSP headers / meta tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

## Installation

To install a bookmarklet, visit the most
recent [list of installable bookmarklets](https://tollwerk.github.io/a11y-bookmarklets) and drag the link to your
browser bookmarks.
